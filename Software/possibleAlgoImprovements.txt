parse all past temperature and louver position data for "workable" timestamps with intermediate louver position values (0<pos<1) and only use these points for the recalibration process

use set number (n) "workable" points, as time goes on, the points act as a rolling average

set deltaT in __getNewPos to 2*(target - measured) to keep the heat centered on the target, rather than on the target - 1/2 * coolingAmountWhileHeatIsOff
